# Dependencies
# Make sure Django is installed (if not, install with `pip install django`).

# To start a new Django project (you only need to do this once to create a new project):
django-admin startproject mysite

# To run the Django server locally on the default port (8000):
python3 manage.py runserver

    # Open in browser on the same machine (local only):
    # http://127.0.0.1:8000/ or http://localhost:8000/

    # Open in browser on another device on the same Wi-Fi network by replacing with your local IP:
    # http://192.168.0.210:8000/ (replace with your actual local IP)
#



# To make the Django server accessible on all network interfaces (e.g., for other devices on the same network):
python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

    # Open in browser on the same machine:
    # http://127.0.0.1:8000/

    # Open in browser on another device on the same Wi-Fi network:
    # http://192.168.0.210:8000/ (replace with your actual local IP)
#



# Running on a public server using Ngrok
# To make the server accessible over the internet, follow these steps:

# 1. Run Django on port 8080:
python3 manage.py runserver 8080

# 2. Start Ngrok to create a public URL for your server:
ngrok http 8080

    # This will provide a public URL, such as:
    # https://2544-203-30-15-91.ngrok-free.app
    # Share this link to allow others to access your Django app from anywhere.
