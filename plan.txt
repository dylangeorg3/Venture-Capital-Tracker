- Develop a software with a nice GUI that can keep track of early stage investments

- Requirements
    - GUI (not just in terminal)
    - Save data to onedrive for use across multiple computers, or web based? weigh up pros and cons
        - Web based is not a good idea (I'm not a cybersecurity expert)
    - Use Firebase to store data 
    - Have different users to require log in
    - Keep somewhat safe from SQL injections and cybersecurity issues
        - NEED TO CHANGE ALLOWED HOSTS FOR PRODUCTION

    - create company
    - add and change data of company
    - track current value of company
    - different sections for current portfolio vs companies being scouted
    - produce risk metrics and confidence metrics for each company

- Agile Development Plan
    - Stage 1 (Early Development):
        - Get very basic working GUI
        - Set up basic functionality for metrics
    - Stage 2:
        - 


    - Later improvements
        - Machine learning algorithm trained on previous data to make predictions
        - Improve GUI aesthetics 
        - Extra detail for each company: upload employee photos, contact details, etc
